Hello, my name is Xiangmeng Qin, I'm from Beijing, China.
I'm enthusiastic about the world of economics, programming, and data.
These three fields have always captivated me because of their potential to create meaningful insights and solutions.
In the realm of economics, I am fascinated by how it shapes the world and influences decision-making processes. It's not just about numbers and graphs; it's about understanding human behavior, market dynamics, and the global economy. I believe that economics can provide valuable insights into complex societal issues and help us make informed choices.
